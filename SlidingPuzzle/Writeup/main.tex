% graphicx is a very useful package for inserting graphics into your paper. See
% below for more information and examples
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

A brief summary of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Introduction
        \item Set-up
        \item Results
        \item Conclusion

\section{Introduction}
What is a sliding puzzle?
Previous research done.\cite{textbook}
Method used to randomize puzzle.
Hypothesis: Using a Straight Line heuristic will result in better overall performance, including space, time, and effective branching factor.

Manhattan treats all movements towards the goal equally.
Straight line will give lower heuristic when moving tile close to goal towards goal than when moving tile far from goal towards goal.

Discuss complexity:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 24-puzzle has about 10 to the 25 states.
        \item Upper bound of 208 moves needed to solve puzzle, lower of 152
        \item Branching factor 4
    \end{itemize}
With a maximum depth of the upper bound maximum number of moves needed to solve puzzle d, and a branching factor of 4, search space is:
\begin{equation}
    O(n) = 4^{d}
\end{equation}


\section{Experimental Set-Up}
In this experiment we set up...
We randomized puzzles by...
Test cases
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 24-puzzles
        \item 10 different initial puzzles, each with a different starting heuristic.
    \end{itemize}

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation results for the network.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

\section{Results}
These are the results after running tests on the 10 puzzles.
Different graphs measure:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Time taken(y) vs starting heuristic(x)
        \item Space taken(y) vs starting heuristic(x)
        \item Effective Branching Factor(y) vs starting(x) heuristic
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Discuss data
        \item Explain which heuristic did better
        \item Explain why
    \end{itemize}
\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
Discuss if results match hypothesis.
Things to do in future experiments:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Test more puzzles.
        \item More modifications of heuristic.
        \item More modifications of algorithm.
    \end{itemize}
