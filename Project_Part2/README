Cryptarithmatic code is in the folder "Crypt".
Run the code "Crypt_tester.py" with no arguements and follow the 
instructions.
I am not aware of any bugs in the code assuming proper test input.
It runs tests from testCrypt.txt.
It can only solve addition problems. It can only solve problems that 
contain no more than 3 different letters in a column

The constraints used in this AC3 constrain all letters to be different.
It also constrains each column to add up properly. 

Crossmath code is in the folder "CrossMath"
Run the code "Cross_tester.py" with no arguements and follow the 
instructions. It includes tests for AC3, MAC, and DFS. MRV code is 
submitted separately by my collaborator for this problem.
The code is complete.
I am not aware of any bugs in the code, assuming proper test input.
It runs tests from testCrossMath.txt, and can only solve 3x3 puzzles

The constraints used in this AC3 constrain all space to be different.
It also constrains each column and row by the given equations.
